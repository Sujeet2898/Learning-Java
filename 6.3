Problem Statement
Create a class Square which has both default constructor and parameterized constructor, a length parameter, and a printArea method which take the length as an argument and prints the area. In the case of the default parameter, the default value of length will be equal to 10.
All the Input and Output methods are take care by compiler you don't have to worry about it.



class Square {
// Write your code here
   int length;
   Square(){
       this.length = 10;
       System.out.println(getArea(this.length));
   }
   Square(int length){
       this.length = length;
       System.out.println(getArea(this.length));
   }
   
   int getArea(int length){
      return length*length;
   }
}

class Solution {

public static void main(String args[]) {
 
 // Write your code here
 Square square = new Square();
       Square square2 = new Square(7);
}
}

output:
100
49
