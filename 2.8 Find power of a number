Problem Statement
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e., x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note: For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1



import java.util.*;
class Solution {
	  public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println((int)Math.pow(x,n));
	}
}
