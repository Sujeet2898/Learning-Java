# Learning-Java
Java is an object-oriented, class-based, secured, platform-independent, and general-purpose programming language. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystemâ€™s Java platform. Java programming language is based on the write once, run anywhere (WORA) principle, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying operating system. 

Java is the most popular, widely used object-oriented programming language. By using java, we can develop a variety of applications such as web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, network applications, and many more. Java is used for developing different applications. Some of them are listed below:
1. Banking: In banking, the Java programming language is used to develop transaction management.
2. Mobile App Development: Java can be used to develop mobile applications. Most of the android applications are built using java. So, if you are familiar with java, it  will become much easier to develop mobile applications.
3. Desktop Applications: We can also create GUI applications in java. Java provides AWT, Swings, and JavaFX to develop desktop applications.
4. Big Data: In Big Data, the Hadoop MapReduce framework is written using java.
5. Web applications: We can also create web applications using java. The most popular frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate used for developing web applications are based on java.
