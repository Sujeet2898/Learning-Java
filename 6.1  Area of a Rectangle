Problem Statement
Design a class called Rectangle. It contains two data members as length(L) and breadth(B); and a member function getArea(). The member function computes the area of the given rectangle and returns it to the caller.
Note:
Area of a rectangle = length x breadth


Solution:

public class Rectangle { 
    // Write your code here.
    public static int length;

   public static int breadth;

   int getArea(){

       return length*breadth;

   }
}

Input:
